                <p>The OSU Forest Ecophysiology Lab is dedicated to investigating the responses of forest ecosystems to climate change. Our research focuses on understanding how we can use physiological ecology to study vegetation responses to natural disturbances or other environmental stressors across different ecosystems, including tropical forests and temperate mountain systems. We employ a variety of methodologies, including conducting empirical measurements of plant ecophysiology, long-term monitoring of forest dynamics, Bayesian statistics, and process-based modeling. If this something you are interest in, do not hesitate in reaching out!</p>

                <h4><s>Now hiring!!! Undergraduate research opportunity</s> </h4>
                <p>
                    Seeking 1 summer intern to contribute to a National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research (NSF LTER) project investigating how interacting abiotic stressors limit forest productivity. The REU intern will develop research to tease apart the effects of heat stress and water limitation on individual tree growth. The student will help to monitor water potentials, tree growth, and sap flux in adult Douglas Fir trees part of an irrigation experiment. Additionally the student will be provided the opportunity to assist on measurements of soil hydraulic properties. Project mentors include: German Vargas G., Justine Rojas, Mark Schulze, Chris Still, and Pam Sullivan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This internship will provide the undergraduate student an opportunity to participate in 10 weeks of mentored, paid, independent research. The student will interact with scientists, university faculty, federal scientists, and graduate students conducting research in the area. The REU student will conduct supervised and guided research and be encouraged to tailor the research project to their own interests. Apartment-style, shared-room housing is provided at the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest field station. The field station is located in the Willamette National Forest near Blue River, OR and provides access to great hiking and mountain biking trails, swimming holes, and other outdoor recreational opportunities. The field station community ranges in size seasonally from 40-70 residents, and includes permanent staff, longer term field crews, visiting writers and artists, shorter term research crews, classes and conferences.The Lookout Creek watershed contains old growth coniferous forests, clear fast streams and diverse montane meadows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Housing and a stipend of $6000 will be provided. Please note that the REU program is considered an educational program rather than employment; therefore, Oregon State University (OSU) does not provide Worker’s Compensation insurance coverage nor medical insurance on your behalf. You are responsible for your own health insurance coverage.
                </p>
                <p>
                   <strong>To apply, please send:</strong> 1) a cover letter outlining your interests and relevant experience, 2) CV, and 3) contact information for three professional references to: vargasgg@oregonstate.edu with the subject <strong>”HJA REU 2025 Application”.</strong> Only complete applications will be considered. Review of applications will start April 1st, 2025 and continue until a suitable candidate is identified. <a href="pdfs/ThirstyTrees.pdf"> <strong>More information here.</strong></a>
